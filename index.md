Welcome to the Academy Library. Here you’ll find resources to support your learning and involvement with the academy.

Consider this the entranceway. It features  a live view of the learning initiatives that are underway (follow the links to commits to see the action in detail).

There’s something for everyone. All levels of learners are catered for. Take a look around and [book a session](https://prescriptionfree.academy/) when you’re ready to get started.

Our Education Director (Nigel) is also chief librarian and maintains this site by hand using Markdown, Jekyll, GitHub Pages and a combination of Working Copy (iOS Git client) and some WebStorm and other editors.

# Learning Initiatives

This page features all of the available learning initiatives from [Prescription Free Academy](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

- [Practice Projects](#practice-projects)
- [Learning Projects](#learning-projects)
- [Tasks for Coding Practice](#tasks-for-coding-practice)
- [Open Source Projects](#open-source-projects)
- [Contribute to the School](#contribute-to-the-school)

## Practice Projects

Gain experience creating real applications using web technologies. A great way to start pulling things together if you’ve already picked up some of the basics. Some are independent parts of our larger collaborative learning programs.

## Tasks for Coding Practice

Collections of practice tasks to improve your coding skills. Learn and practice essential techniques for crafting software.

**The Big Three: Arrays, Objects, Collections**    
[Currently in Production]

**Codifying Logic: Make Decisions with Code**    
[Not Currently in Production]

**Repeat Yourself: Loops, Iteration and Scope**    
[Not Currently in Production]

We are working on these the week commencing November 25. Plenty more to come. Collections to cover all of the basic coding techniques. How to put the pieces together to build software.

Some are part of larger collaborative projects but can be undertaken in isolation.

Book a session with Nigel for help getting started if this initiative seems interesting but you don’t know where to start.

---

## Contribute to the School

A great way to learn is to be involved in teaching others. Work with Nigel to help prepare learning materials while benefiting from free class time. Tasks will be offered  that suit what you’re currently learning.

Due to the nature of this work, it’s only available to learners who are already taking regular classes. Visit [Open Tasks](/open-tasks) to see some notes on what’s currently needed.

---

## Collaborative Learning Programs

Our pièce de résistance. Gain experience in a real working environment lead by an experienced lead engineer. This is just getting started and we’re excited about the possibilities.

A second program is coming soon (building a web framework). All programs here require a substantial time commitment to get real value.

If you don’t have available a few hours minimum per week, a practice or open source project is likely a better choice.

- Great for the resume/CV if you’re looking to get a career started.
- Great for getting some practical experience if you’ve been studying.
